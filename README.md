Entropy
=======
This is a Rhythmbox plugin that stops Rhythmbox after playing the last entry in
the play queue, instead of going back to whatever happened to be selected.

Installation
------------
Simply copy the entire directory tree to the Rhythmbox plugins directory. For
a local user on a UNIX-like system, this is ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins.
If you have an old (pre-3.0) version of Rhythmbox, you will need to change
`Loader=python3` to `Loader=python` in `entropy.plugin`.

There is no configuration. At present, the only way to disable this behaviour
is to disable the plugin.
