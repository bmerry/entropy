Entropy
=======
This is a Rhythmbox plugin that stops Rhythmbox after playing the last entry in
the play queue, instead of going back to whatever happened to be selected.

Installation
------------
Simply copy the entire directory tree to the Rhythmbox plugins directory. For
a local user on a UNIX-like system, this is ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins.
This has only be tested with Rhythmbox 2.99, which uses Python 2. Your mileage
may vary with Rhythmbox 3.x, which uses Python 3. At a minimum you will need
to change the Loader in `rbcpf.plugin` from `python` to `python3`.

There is no configuration. At present, the only way to disable this behaviour
is to disable the plugin.
